Don't be too greedy! Take it slow and steady.
Release a balloon to check the path ahead.
Once you launch a balloon, you can't take it back—so think carefully!
Carefully observing the terrain might reveal some hints.
There could be hidden traps along the way!
Align your aim with your view to launch in the right direction.
Balloons travel the farthest when launched slightly upward.
Reaching certain points will allow you to restart from there.
Listening to calm music can help you relax.
Sometimes, patience is key—take your time and move carefully.
Don't worry, you can do this!
Just like this balloon, keep challenging yourself!
Always keep an eye on the charge arrow!
You can cancel anytime while charging.
Rotate the camera to make sure you're launching in the right direction.
